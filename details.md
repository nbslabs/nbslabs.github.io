### 2. The Business Model: A Hybrid Social Enterprise

This model allows you to have two interconnected arms: a non-profit/community arm and a for-profit arm.

**A. The Community/Non-Profit Arm (The Heart ❤️)**
This is where you build your brand, community, and social impact. This arm is what will attract donors and volunteers.

* **Activities:**
    * **Free Workshops:** Weekly or bi-weekly live sessions on YouTube/Facebook on specific topics (e.g., "Intro to Git," "Your First Python Script," "Using ChatGPT for Code Debugging").
    * **Open Source Projects:** Maintain 1-2 core open-source projects on GitHub. This showcases skills and allows others to contribute.
    * **Kids' Coding Club:** A weekend online session using tools like Scratch for younger kids, and Python/JavaScript for older ones.
    * **Content Creation:** Blog posts on `nbslabs.dev`, short tutorials on social media.

* **Funding:**
    * Donations (Patreon, Buy Me a Coffee, local gateways like bKash/Nagad for direct support).
    * Corporate Sponsorships for specific events (e.g., "This month's Kids' Coding is sponsored by...").
    * Grants from local or international organizations focused on tech education.

**B. The For-Profit Arm (The Engine ⚙️)**
This is how you sustain the organization and generate personal income. These are premium offerings for those who can and want to pay for a deeper, more structured experience.

* **Activities & Revenue Streams:**
    * **Advanced Bootcamps:** Multi-week, intensive paid courses on specialized topics (e.g., "Full-Stack Web Development with MERN," "Advanced DevOps with Docker & Kubernetes").
    * **Corporate Training:** Offer training packages to companies in Bangladesh to upskill their engineering teams on new technologies. Your experience at Therap is a huge asset here.
    * **Consulting Services:** Leverage the `nbslabs` brand to offer freelance consulting or project development services.
    * **Premium Mentorship:** A paid 1-on-1 mentorship program for university students or junior developers looking for career guidance.
    * **"Vibe Coding" Sessions:** This is a unique concept! You can frame it as paid, guided project-building sessions where a small group codes along with you in a relaxed, "flow-state" environment, with AI tools assisting the process.

This hybrid model allows you to truthfully say, "Our core resources are free for the community, thanks to the support of our donors and our premium services."

### 3. A Concrete Phased Action Plan

You can't do everything at once. Let's phase it out.

#### Phase 1: Foundation & Community Building (First 6 Months)

**Goal:** Build a name, an audience, and credibility. Focus entirely on the **Community Arm**.

* **Month 1: Setup & Launch**
    * **Website:** Set up a simple landing page on `nbslabs.dev`. Include an "About Me" section, your mission, and a form to sign up for a newsletter.
    * **Social Media:** Create professional pages on LinkedIn, Facebook, and a YouTube channel.
    * **Announce:** Write a sincere post on your personal LinkedIn/Facebook profile announcing `nbslabs`, its mission, and what you hope to achieve.
    * **First Event:** Schedule and heavily promote your first FREE live workshop. **Topic Idea:** "5 AI Tools That Will Change How You Code in 2026."

* **Months 2-6: Consistency & Engagement**
    * **Content Cadence:** Host one free workshop every 2-3 weeks. Post one short-form tip or video per week.
    * **Launch Open Source:** Start your first open-source project. It shouldn't be massive. **Idea:** A simple utility library for a common task in a popular framework, or a boilerplate template. Announce it and invite contributors.
    * **Start Kids' Coding:** Launch a free monthly "Hour of Code" for kids. Record it and put it on YouTube.
    * **Build the Newsletter:** Consistently ask people to sign up. Send a monthly recap of activities and upcoming events.
    * **Network:** Connect with university tech clubs and other developers in Dhaka.

#### Phase 2: Growth & Initial Monetization (Months 7-18)

**Goal:** Solidify your community offerings and test the waters for paid services.

* **Introduce Donation Channels:** Set up Patreon or a local donation method. Be transparent about what the funds will be used for (e.g., "to cover platform costs," "to buy resources for our kids' coding program").
* **First Paid Workshop:** Launch your first small, paid workshop. Price it affordably. **Idea:** "A 3-Day Weekend Bootcamp on Building a REST API with Node.js/Express."
* **Collaborate:** Co-host sessions with other well-known figures in the Bangladeshi tech community. This expands your reach.
* **Seek Sponsorships:** Create a small sponsorship package and pitch it to local tech companies for your free events.

#### Phase 3: Scaling & Sustainability (Months 18+)

**Goal:** Establish `nbslabs` as a self-sustaining social enterprise.

* **Develop Core Paid Offerings:** Based on feedback from Phase 2, create a flagship paid bootcamp or corporate training module.
* **Formalize:** Consider the legal structure. In Bangladesh, you might operate as a sole proprietorship initially. As you grow, you could explore creating a formal company for the for-profit arm and a trust or foundation for the non-profit arm (consult with a legal professional for this).
* **Team Up:** You can't do it all alone. Bring in trusted collaborators or hire interns/part-time instructors to help manage the workload.
* **Expand Consulting:** With a strong brand, you can now more effectively market your consulting services under the `nbslabs` banner.

### 4. Your Unique Selling Points: AI & "Vibe Coding"

* **AI in Coding:** This is a hot topic. Don't just teach coding; teach *modern* coding. Create workshops on:
    * Effective Prompt Engineering for Developers.
    * Mastering GitHub Copilot.
    * Using AI for automated testing and code reviews.
    * Building simple applications with OpenAI/Gemini APIs.

* **"Vibe Coding":** Frame this as your signature style. It’s about the *feeling* and *flow* of development, not just the syntax. It's about intuitive problem-solving, augmented by AI. Market this as a unique, less intimidating way to learn and build, which will be very attractive to beginners.
